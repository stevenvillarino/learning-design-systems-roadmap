# What is a Design System?

A **design system** is a comprehensive collection of reusable components, patterns, guidelines, and standards that help teams build consistent, accessible, and scalable digital products.

## Core Components

### 1. Design Language
Your design language defines the visual and experiential foundation of your product. It includes:

- **Color palettes** - Primary, secondary, and semantic colors
- **Typography** - Font families, sizes, weights, and hierarchy
- **Spacing** - Consistent spacing scales and layout grids
- **Iconography** - Icon style and usage guidelines

### 2. Component Library
A collection of reusable UI components that implement your design language:

```jsx
// Example: Button component
<Button variant="primary" size="medium">
  Click me
</Button>
```

Components should be:
- **Reusable** across different contexts
- **Accessible** (WCAG compliant)
- **Well-documented** with clear examples
- **Flexible** but opinionated

### 3. Guidelines and Documentation
Clear documentation helps teams understand:

- When and how to use components
- Design principles and best practices
- Accessibility requirements
- Code examples and API references

## Why Design Systems Matter

> "A design system isn't a project. It's a product, serving products." — Nathan Curtis

### Benefits for Teams

1. **Consistency** - Users get a cohesive experience across all touchpoints
2. **Efficiency** - Designers and developers work faster with pre-built components
3. **Quality** - Shared standards improve accessibility and usability
4. **Scale** - New features can be built quickly using existing patterns

### Real-World Examples

- **Material Design** (Google) - Comprehensive system for Android and web
- **Polaris** (Shopify) - E-commerce focused design system
- **Carbon** (IBM) - Enterprise-grade open-source system

## Getting Started

Before building a design system, consider:

1. **What problem are you solving?** - Don't build a system just to have one
2. **Who is your audience?** - Internal teams, external developers, or both?
3. **What's your scope?** - Start small and expand based on actual needs
4. **How will you maintain it?** - Design systems require ongoing investment

## Key Takeaways

- A design system is more than a component library—it's a living product
- Success requires buy-in from design, engineering, and product teams
- Start with the most commonly used patterns and expand over time
- Documentation and governance are just as important as the components themselves
