## Rationale for Selection

1. **Next.js + React**: Chosen for their modern features, wide adoption, and excellent developer experience. Next.js provides both static site generation and server-side rendering capabilities, making it versatile for future enhancements.

2. **ShadCN UI + Tailwind CSS**: Selected for their modern aesthetic, accessibility features, and ease of customization. ShadCN provides high-quality components while Tailwind enables rapid styling without writing custom CSS.

3. **React Flow**: Chosen for its specialized capabilities in creating interactive node-based diagrams, which is perfect for visualizing the roadmap structure.

4. **LocalStorage**: Selected for its simplicity and browser compatibility, making it ideal for session-based progress tracking without requiring authentication.

5. **Railway**: Chosen for its simplicity in deployment and integration with GitHub, making it easy to deploy and update the application.

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Configure Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI
3. Implement basic layout and navigation
4. Create roadmap data structure
5. Implement roadmap visualization with React Flow
6. Create session management and progress tracking
7. Implement lesson content display
8. Add responsive design and mobile optimization
9. Deploy to Railway

This technology stack provides a modern, performant foundation for the interactive design system roadmap, with room for future enhancements as needed.
