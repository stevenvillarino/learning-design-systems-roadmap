still having issues "No GitHub remotes found that contain this commit."

_**Assistant**_

The error "No GitHub remotes found that contain this commit" usually means that your local commit hasn't been pushed to any remote repository, or your local repository isn't properly connected to a GitHub remote.

Let's troubleshoot and resolve this:

1. Check your current git remotes.
2. Verify if your commit exists locally and if it has been pushed.
3. Push your commit to the correct remote if needed.

I'll start by checking your current git remotes. Your local commit has now been pushed to the GitHub remote. The error "No GitHub remotes found that contain this commit" should be resolved.

If you try your previous operation again (such as creating a pull request or referencing the commit on GitHub), it should now work as expected. Let me know if you need further help!
