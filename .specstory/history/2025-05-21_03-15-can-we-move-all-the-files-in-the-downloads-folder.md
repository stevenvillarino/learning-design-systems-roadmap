# can we move all the files in the downloads folder  (2025-05-20 20:15:21)

_**User**_

can we move all the files in the downloads folder outside of it? 

---

_**Assistant**_

I don't have access to the Downloads folder at that location, so I can't move the files directly. If you want to move files from your system's main Downloads folder, please clarify, or move them manually to a location within the allowed workspace. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

How's all the structure and everything?

---

_**Assistant**_

Your project folder is named `learning-design-systems-roadmap`. To give you feedback on the structure and organization, I’d need to see a list of the files and folders inside it.  
You can provide this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
ls -R
```

Or, if you want a tree view (if you have `tree` installed):

```
tree
```

Paste the output here, and I’ll review your project structure and offer suggestions!
