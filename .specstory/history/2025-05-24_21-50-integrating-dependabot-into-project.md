_**Assistant**_

To integrate Dependabot into your project, you need to add a configuration file named `.github/dependabot.yml` to your repository. This file tells Dependabot which package managers to check for updates, how often to check, and which directories to scan.

**Reasoning:**
- Dependabot is a GitHub-native tool, so it requires a `.github` directory at the root of your project.
- The config file specifies update frequency, package-ecosystem (like npm for Node.js), and the directory containing your manifest files (e.g., `package.json`).
- This is a non-intrusive, best-practice way to keep dependencies up to date and secure.

**Steps:**
1. Create a `.github` directory at the root if it doesn't exist.
2. Add a `dependabot.yml` file with the correct configuration for a Node.js (npm) project.

I will now create the `.github/dependabot.yml` file with a simple, recommended configuration for your project.

Dependabot has been integrated into your project. I created a `.github/dependabot.yml` file with the following configuration:

- Checks for npm (Node.js) dependency updates.
- Scans the root directory (where your `package.json` is).
- Runs weekly.
- Limits to 5 open pull requests at a time.

**How to test:**
1. Push your changes to GitHub.
2. Dependabot will automatically start checking for updates on the next schedule, or you can trigger it manually from the GitHub UI (under "Security" > "Dependabot" or "Pull requests").

**Next steps:**
- You can customize the schedule or add more ecosystems (like GitHub Actions) if needed.
- Review and merge Dependabot PRs as they appear.

Let me know if you want to adjust the configuration or add more package ecosystems!
