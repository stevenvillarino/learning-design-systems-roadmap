I can see the issue from the error message. The problem is that you're using an outdated way to configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. The error indicates that the PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package and needs to be updated.

Let me check your current PostCSS configuration and package.json to fix this issue.

---

Read file: postcss.config.js

---

Read file: package.json

---

Perfect! I can see the issue and the solution. You already have `@tailwindcss/postcss` installed in your dependencies (version 4.1.7), but your `postcss.config.js` file is still using the old configuration format with `tailwindcss: {}`.

The fix is to update your PostCSS configuration to use the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin instead of the old `tailwindcss` plugin.

---

```diff
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
-     tailwindcss: {},
+     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
```

---

The issue has been fixed! Here's what I changed:

**Problem**: Your `postcss.config.js` was using the old `tailwindcss` plugin configuration, but Tailwind CSS v4+ requires using the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin.

**Solution**: I updated your PostCSS configuration to use `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}` instead of `tailwindcss: {}`.

This change aligns with the new architecture in Tailwind CSS v4 where the PostCSS plugin has been moved to a separate package. Your `package.json` already had the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss` dependency installed, so now your configuration matches the installed packages.

The deployment should now work correctly on Vercel. You can push this change and try deploying again.
