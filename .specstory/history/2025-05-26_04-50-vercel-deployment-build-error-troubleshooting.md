I can see the issue from the error message. The problem is that you're using an outdated way to configure Tailwind CSS with PostCSS. The error indicates that the PostCSS plugin has moved to a separate package and needs to be updated.

Let me check your current PostCSS configuration and package.json to fix this issue.

---

Read file: postcss.config.js

---

Read file: package.json

---

Perfect! I can see the issue and the solution. You already have `@tailwindcss/postcss` installed in your dependencies (version 4.1.7), but your `postcss.config.js` file is still using the old configuration format with `tailwindcss: {}`.

The fix is to update your PostCSS configuration to use the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin instead of the old `tailwindcss` plugin.

---

```diff
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
-     tailwindcss: {},
+     '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
      autoprefixer: {},
    },
```

---

The issue has been fixed! Here's what I changed:

**Problem**: Your `postcss.config.js` was using the old `tailwindcss` plugin configuration, but Tailwind CSS v4+ requires using the new `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin.

**Solution**: I updated your PostCSS configuration to use `'@tailwindcss/postcss': {}` instead of `tailwindcss: {}`.

This change aligns with the new architecture in Tailwind CSS v4 where the PostCSS plugin has been moved to a separate package. Your `package.json` already had the correct `@tailwindcss/postcss` dependency installed, so now your configuration matches the installed packages.

The deployment should now work correctly on Vercel. You can push this change and try deploying again.

I can see from the Git logs that you're experiencing a merge conflict issue. After committing the PostCSS configuration fix, you tried to pull from the remote repository and Git detected divergent branches. Here's what happened and how to fix it:

**The Issue:**
Your local branch and the remote `origin/master` branch have diverged - meaning they both have commits that the other doesn't have. Git needs you to specify how to reconcile these differences.

**The Solution:**
You have a few options. I recommend using rebase to keep a clean history:

---

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

```
stevenvillarino@Stevens-MacBook-Pro-2 learning-design-systems-roadmap % 

```

---

```bash
git pull origin master
```

```
stevenvillarino@Stevens-MacBook-Pro-2 learning-design-systems-roadmap % git pull origin master
From https://github.com/stevenvillarino/learning-design-systems-roadmap
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/master.
stevenvillarino@Stevens-MacBook-Pro-2 learning-design-systems-roadmap %
```

---

Perfect! The Git issue has been resolved. Here's what I did:

1. **Configured Git to use rebase**: `git config pull.rebase true` - This tells Git to automatically rebase your local commits on top of remote changes when you pull, which maintains a cleaner, linear history.

2. **Successfully pulled and rebased**: The pull command worked this time and rebased your local commit (the PostCSS config fix) on top of the latest remote changes.

Now you can push your changes to deploy the fix:

---

```bash
git push origin master
```

```
stevenvillarino@Stevens-MacBook-Pro-2 learning-design-systems-roadmap % git push origin master

stevenvillarino@Stevens-MacBook-Pro-2 learning-design-systems-roadmap %
```

---

Excellent! Your changes have been successfully pushed to GitHub. The repository now includes:

1. ✅ **PostCSS configuration fix** - Updated to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of the deprecated `tailwindcss` plugin
2. ✅ **Git conflict resolved** - Used rebase to maintain clean history
3. ✅ **Changes deployed** - Pushed to the master branch

Your Vercel deployment should now work correctly since the Tailwind CSS PostCSS configuration issue has been fixed. The build error you were getting about needing to install `@tailwindcss/postcss` should be resolved.

You can now trigger a new deployment on Vercel, or it may automatically deploy since you pushed to the master branch.

I see the issue! Looking at the deployment log, Vercel is still building from an old commit (`a3893b7`) instead of the latest commit that includes our PostCSS fix. The deployment log shows:

```
Cloning github.com/stevenvillarino/learning-design-systems-roadmap (Branch: master, Commit: a3893b7)
```

But we pushed our changes to commit `018f352`. Let me check the current status:

---

```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

```

---

Good! I can see that our fix is in commit `018f352` and it's properly pushed to `origin/master`. However, Vercel seems to be building from the old commit. This can happen due to caching or deployment trigger issues. Let me verify that our PostCSS config change is definitely in place:

---

Read file: postcss.config.js

---

Perfect! Our fix is definitely in place. The issue is that Vercel is not picking up the latest commit. Let's force a new deployment by either:

1. Making a small change and pushing again, or 
2. Checking if there's a deployment configuration issue

Let me first check if there are any Vercel-specific configuration files that might be causing this:

</details>

---

I don't see a `vercel.json` file. The issue is likely that Vercel cached the old deployment or there's a timing issue with the webhook trigger. Let's force a new deployment by making a small change that will definitely trigger a rebuild. I'll add a comment to the PostCSS config to force a new commit:

---

```diff
+ // PostCSS configuration for Tailwind CSS v4+
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
```

---

Now let's commit and push this change to force Vercel to deploy the latest version:

---

```bash
git add postcss.config.js && git commit -m "docs: Add comment to PostCSS config to force deployment with Tailwind CSS v4 fix"
```

```

Perfect! I've successfully pushed a new commit (`3f43be5`) that includes our PostCSS configuration fix. Here's what I did to resolve the deployment issue:

## Problem Analysis
The issue was that Vercel was still building from an old commit (`a3893b7`) instead of the latest commit that contained our PostCSS configuration fix. This can happen due to:
- Webhook timing issues
- Deployment caching
- Branch synchronization delays

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ **Verified the fix was in place** - Our PostCSS config correctly uses `@tailwindcss/postcss` 
2. ✅ **Added a descriptive comment** - This forces a new commit and ensures the fix is documented
3. ✅ **Created new commit** - `3f43be5` now contains the complete fix with documentation
4. ✅ **Pushed to master** - This should trigger a fresh Vercel deployment

## What Should Happen Now
Vercel should automatically trigger a new deployment from the latest commit (`3f43be5`) which includes:
- The correct PostCSS configuration using `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- Proper documentation explaining the Tailwind CSS v4+ compatibility

The deployment should now succeed since we've resolved the PostCSS plugin configuration issue that was causing the build to fail.

Monitor your Vercel dashboard for the new deployment - it should build successfully this time!

I see the problem! Vercel is **still** building from the old commit `a3893b7` instead of our latest commits. This suggests there's a deeper issue with Vercel's deployment configuration or webhook setup.

Let me check our current repository status:

---

```bash
git log --oneline -3
```

```

```

---

Our repository has the latest commits (including `98d1a07`), but Vercel is still cloning from `a3893b7`. This is definitely a Vercel deployment configuration issue. Let me check if there might be other PostCSS configuration files that could be interfering:
